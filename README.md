NewPipe Extractor [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor)
=================


This is the system independent core of [NewPipe](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe).
It can be used to create your own java based NewPipe client.

A small example showing how to use the extractor can be found [here](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/np-cli).

## Usage
Using this Extractor in your own open source projects is simple. We offer this extractor as maven repository, so if you use
gradle you can simple include NewPipeExtractor to your project by adding this line to the dependencies:

`compile 'com.github.TeamNewPipe:NewPipeExtractor:7ae274`

A fill documentation is no yet there, but it will follow :) Stay tuned.
